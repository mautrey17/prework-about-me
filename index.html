      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>Hello! Currently I am employed as a Spanish teacher but have always been interested in computers. I am ready for my next challenge to enter the world of web dev!</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>Wake Forest, NC</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
        <ul>
          <li>Videogames</li>
          <li>Horseback Riding</li>
          <li>Running</li>
          <li>Walking my dog Daisy</li>
        </ul>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Anything that isn't teaching! A game developer or UX designer</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Morrisville, NC</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I have always been an analytical person, and teaching is not currently satisfying my desire to problem solve and apply creativity in my own projects. Web dev is the logical next move for me because I am very detail oriented, enjoy working on computers, and really want to be able to create web applications and pages from start to finish of which I can be proud.</p>
